It also allows other plugins access to Cumulus\n\nThis page will contain information about class FloodgateApi.\nSee the sidebar for more information about other parts of the API.\n\nAccessing the Floodgate API\nSee here for how to include the Floodgate API in your project.\n\nThe Floodgate API has changed in Floodgate 2.0. The most important change is that the API methods are no longer static and instead instance-based, as shown below.\n\nThe class FloodgateApi is the base class of the API and you need to use it to access any part of the API.\nTo access it, you simply type:\nFloodgateApi.getInstance();\n\n\nAfter you got the instance, you have access to all the methods.\nUse the documentation in the API module to see (and get info about) every single method available.\nMost API methods have a simple explanation.\n\n\n    Note: To see full, detailed documentation, see the javadocs.\n\n\nWe’ll highlight a few to get you started quickly:\nFloodgateApi#isFloodgatePlayer(UUID)\nUsed to check if the given UUID of an online player is a Bedrock player.\n\nFloodgateApi#getPlayer(UUID)\nUsed to get the FloodgatePlayer instance of an online player.\nClick here to get more information about the FloodgatePlayer class.\n\nNote: You don’t need to wait until the Bedrock player is online to use the getPlayer and isFloodgatePlayer methods.\nYou can even use them in the pre-login events.\n\nFloodgateApi#getPlayerLink()\nUsed to get the PlayerLink instance used by Floodgate to check for linked accounts.\nClick here to get more information about the PlayerLink class\n\nFloodgateApi#sendForm(UUID, Form(Builder))\nUsed to send a form to the Bedrock player with the given UUID.\nClick here to get more information about Forms.\n\nUsing the API on backend servers\nIn order to successfully use the API on backend Spigot servers when using a proxy, send-floodgate-data must be set to true on the proxy Floodgate’s config, and the key.pem file must be identical between all Floodgate instances."

Duplicated usernames will cause weird situations, like being unable to teleport to one of the players.\n\nIn your Floodgate config, change username-prefix to whichever prefix you desire - you can set it to \"\" and there will be no prefix.\n\nOn some older Paper servers (or any forks that use them), you may need to also shut down your server and delete your usercache.json file located in the same folder as your server jar to prevent users who already joined from having the old prefix. See this issue for more information.\n\nObtaining UUIDs for Floodgate players\nCheck your server logs, or use this page. If this doesn’t work, then try this method:\n\nFirst, you’ll need to get the XUID of the player. There are several third-party websites to find this, for example, this one (unaffiliated with Geyser). Make sure to choose “Hexidecimal.” You’ll need to enter the player’s Xbox Gamertag, and, once submitted, and it should display the XUID in the format of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. To turn the XUID into a UUID that Java Edition can recognize, you need to put the XUID in this format: 00000000-0000-0000-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. If formatted right, Java Edition should accept it as a UUID.\n\nUsing PlaceholderAPI\nIf you’re using the Spigot version of Floodgate, download the Placeholder plugin here. Using the placeholders shouldn’t require additional setup other than having PlaceholderAPI installed. See the section above on installing Floodgate on backend servers if you wish to use this on BungeeCord.\n\nUsing Skript\nIf you’re using the Spigot version of Floodgate, there is an unofficial plugin that adds Skript support here."

It is responsible for converting Bedrock skins to Java skins and uploading them to Mojang servers make them show up on Java Edition.\n\nWe’re using MineSkin internally. MineSkin is running on accounts donated by the community. So if you want to support MineSkin and make the upload times faster, feel free to look at this page for more info."

						"content": "Known Issues &amp; Caveats\nIf an issue you’re experiencing is not listed here, please consider joining the Geyser Discord.\n\nRunning commands\nIn some instances, like if you have the username-prefix set to *, you may need to wrap the Bedrock player’s username in quotes; for example: /tp \"*BedrockPlayer\". Setting the prefix to . should also fix this.\n\nIf you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!\nIt is likely you have enabled send-floodgate-data in your Floodgate config but either Floodgate isn’t installed on the target server, or your floodgate key isn’t the same between the installs of the plugin (please copy them so they all use the same key).\n\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot reply to EncryptionRequestPacket without profile and access token.\n\nMake sure the server has Floodgate installed and started up correctly. Otherwise, see if the next line fixes your error.\n\njavax.crypto.AEADBadTagException: Tag mismatch!\n\nIf Geyser and Floodgate are on the same server, shut down your server, delete the floodgate plugin folder, delete any key file in the Geyser folder, and restart your server.\nIf Geyser and Floodgate are not on the same server and you had to copy the key file, this could also be an error related to uploading through FTP. Using ASCII will not work here, and you need to make sure you’re on binary when uploading. We recommend using WinSCP if you need to use FTP.\n\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: “”\n\nYou’re trying to log in without an Xbox account. Floodgate requires an Xbox account to authenticate the Bedrock player.\n\nGeyser-Floodgate:51777 lost connection: Internal Exception: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: “SfqdXv36” (or a similar error)\n\nSet ip-forwarding in your BungeeCord to true.\n\n“Please connect through the official Geyser” disconnect message\n\nEnsure that Floodgate and Geyser are both up-to-date.\n\nPrefix is not changing on the server after changing it in the config.\n\nBetween the Paper builds of 1.15.2-355 and 1.16.5-505, there was a bug where Floodgate players who had already connected to the server would not have their prefixed changed. Paper builds 1.16.5-506 and later fix this issue.\n\nEnsure that you removed the usercache.json file from the server root directory and restart your server.\n\nIssues with LuckPerms and prefixes\n\nSet allow-invalid-usernames to true in LuckPerms’ config.\n\nFailed to verify username! (with Paper)\n\nTo completely mitigate this issue, disable perform-username-validation in the unsupported settings of the config/paper-global.yml file (paper.yml in the root server folder on servers below 1.19). Using Floodgate on the backend servers will also mitigate this issue.\n\nError with Forge or Fabric Bukkit Hybrid\n\nAt this time, there is no way to run Floodgate on servers that mix Forge and Bukkit or Fabric and Bukkit (For example: Magma, Mohist, and Cardboard/Bukkit4Fabric) - most hybrids do not support the complicated procedures we need to do in order to allow Bedrock players to connect (for the technically minded: these server softwares typically don’t support NMS).\n\nIf you wish to use Floodgate in combination with hybrid servers, we recommend putting these servers behind a BungeeCord or Velocity proxy, and running Floodgate on the proxy.\n\nAfter enabling global linking in offline mode, player data is not synced between Java and Bedrock players.\n\nThis occurs in offline mode because the UUID of the Java account linked to the Bedrock account does not match the online mode UUID returned by Floodgate’s global linking server.\n\nWhen using global linking, ensure online-mode in server.properties is set to true. Otherwise, Bedrock players will not be authenticated with the same UUID they receive when playing on Java Edition, resulting in lost progress. This does not occur with local linking."

					"floodgate-linking": {
						"id": "floodgate-linking",
						"title": "Linking",
						"url": "/floodgate/linking/",
						"content": "What is Global Linking?\nInstructions and information about how to link can also be found here: https://link.geysermc.org/\n\nBefore we introduced Global Linking, you always had to link your Java and Bedrock account on every individual server you visited (that has Floodgate). Global Linking is here to fix that problem. Link once, join everywhere.\n\nKeep in mind: While having your accounts linked, you will use the Java account’s location, inventory data, and achievements etc. regardless of which platform you sign in from (therefore, “synchronising” the player data). The player data from the Bedrock account will not be accessible until you unlink again. As a result, you should transfer everything (ender chest contents, items, armor) to the Java account before linking to not “lose” your Bedrock progress. If you forgot to do this, you can unlink, transfer everything over, and link again.\n\nGlobal Linking is part of the Global Api and uses the GlobalLinkServer to link your account. To be able to link your account you have to do the following:\n\n  Join the GlobalLinkServer with both your Java and Bedrock account\n(IP: link.geysermc.org, Java port: 25565, Bedrock port: 19132)\n  Start the linking process by typing /linkaccount on your Java or Bedrock account\n  You’ll get a message with a random number that you have to enter on the account that you did not start the linking process on.\n  Enter the random number on the other account by typing /linkaccount &lt;code&gt;\n  You should get kicked from the server on both your Bedrock and Java account with the message that it had successfully linked your accounts.\n\n\nTo unlink your globally linked accounts, join the GlobalLinkServer (as described above for linking) on either Java or Bedrock, and use the /unlinkaccount command.\n\nGlobal Linking should be enabled by default on every server running Floodgate 2.0, but in the case that you disabled it, you can enable it again by opening your Floodgate config and make sure that the player-link section looks similar to this:\n# Configuration for player linking\nplayer-link:\n  # Whether to enable the linking system. Turning this off will prevent\n  # players from using the linking feature even if they are already linked.\n  enabled: true\n  # Whether to use global linking. Global linking uses a central server to request link\n  # accounts, allowing people to link once, join everywhere (on servers with global linking).\n  use-global-linking: true\n\n(see the default config)\n\nOnce you saved the config and restarted your server you should be using Global Linking.\n\nIf you don’t want to use Global Linking, you can disable enable-global-linking in the Floodgate config.\n\nLocal Linking\nYou can also set up a local linking database on your server. Local linking can work with Global Linking at the same time. Link entries in your local database will override entries in the Global Linking Server.\n\nNote that you only have to follow these steps on your proxy (BungeeCord or Velocity), if you have one.\n\n\n  Download one of the linking databases extensions here.\nIf you need help picking the right one: choose mysql if you already have a database or want to have a multi-proxy setup. For anything else choose sqlite. The full name should be floodgate-*type*-database.jar.\n  Copy the database extension jar you just downloaded into the floodgate 2.0 plugin folder (e.g. /plugins/floodgate/).\n  Enable enable-own-linking in the player-link section of Floodgate.\n  Set type in the player-link section to your database type (currently either mysql or sqlite). (If you used Floodgate 1.0 and had linking enabled back then; the database type was sqlite).\n  Restart your server\n\n\nIf you have selected mysql a new data folder for the database should be generated inside the Floodgate data folder. You can enter your database credentials in there. After you did that restart your server once more.\n\nThat should be it. You can then link your accounts by following the instructions you get when typing /linkaccount."

See Cumulus for more information.\n\nEvents\nThe event package contains all the events that Geyser fires. See here for detailed information on how to listen to Geyser events.\n\nCommand\nThis package contains classes and interfaces related to commands in Geyser, which allows Geyser Extensions to register custom commands.\n\nEntity\nThe Entity package contains classes and interfaces related to entities in Geyser, like the GeyserPlayerEntity interface, \nwhich represents a player entity in Geyser. This interface extends the GeyserEntity interface, while providing additional functionality specifically for player entities, \nlike currently, showing emotes.\n\nItem\nThe item package contains classes and interfaces related to items in Geyser. You can create custom items and register them using the Geyser API.\nSee here for detailed information on how to register custom items.\n\nBlock\nThe block package contains classes and interfaces related to blocks in Geyser. You can create custom blocks using this package, and register them in using the GeyserDefineCustomBlocksEvent.\nSee here for detailed information.\n\nNetwork\nThe network package contains basic information about the remote server via the \nRemoteServer\ninterface, such as the server’s IP address and port, and the protocol version of the remote server. Or the auth type.\nYou can also get the port/IP that Geyser listens to via the BedrockListener interface.\n\nPack\nThe pack package contains classes and interfaces related to resource packs in Geyser. You can create custom resource packs and send them to individual sessions before they log in using the SessionLoadResourcePacksEvent.\nIf you wish to send a resource pack to all sessions, you can use the GeyserLoadResourcePacksEvent.\n\nPacks can be created using a PackCodec, such as the provided PathPackCodec.\nThis allows you to load a Bedrock resource pack from a file path:\nResourcePack pack = ResourcePack.create(PackCodec.path(path));\n\n\nExtension\nThis package provides the necessary components to create and manage extensions.\nFor a more detailed explanation of extensions, see here."

						"content": "Commonly, people may have issues with Geyser not showing up in their server list or run into similar issues. \nThis page contains a few common issues people may encounter that you might have as well as potential fixes for them. \nIf you still can’t make it work, join our Discord for support.\n\nFloodgate\nFor Floodgate issues see: Floodgate: Known Issues/Caveats.\n\nI can’t connect! (Either the server doesn’t show up in the friends list or I get “Unable to connect to world”)\n\n  If you don’t use a reverse proxy such as TCPShield make sure that enable-proxy-protocol is set to false.\nTo fix “Unable to connect to world” with no console errors, see here.\n\n\nIf the server doesn’t show up in the friends list\n\n\n  If using Windows 10, iOS, or Android: try adding the server to the Servers list in-game.\n  If using Xbox One: try connecting with BedrockConnect.\n  If using PS4: try using a LAN proxy.\n  If using Nintendo Switch: there is currently no way for local servers to show up in the Friends tab, but you can still connect using BedrockConnect.\n\n\nIf the Geyser instance is locally hosted: try using localhost or 0.0.0.0 as the IP address.\nIf that doesn’t work, or your Geyser instance is on another computer in the network: use your local IPv4 address.\n\nSee here for fixing “Unable to Connect to World” with no console errors\n\njava.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind on startup.\nThis means something (likely another instance of Geyser) is running on the port you have specified in the config. Please make sure you close all applications running on this port. If you don’t recall opening anything, usually restarting your computer fixes this.\n\n[…] has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 60.0)\n\nSee this link for updating to Java 16: https://paper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java-update/index.html.\n\nHosting provider will not immediately open up UDP.\n\nThese steps only apply for the standalone version of Geyser.\nThis usually has something to do on your host’s end. Most commonly, it’s because they do not open up ports over the UDP protocol, which is what Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses, opposed to Minecraft: Java Edition using TCP. \nOne way to get around this (if you’re using an online host) is to shut down your server, and when asking for a server jar, select Nukkit, or any other Bedrock edition server software (you won’t actually be switching to Nukkit). Afterward, open up your FTP file manager and find the Nukkit jar. Then, replace this jar with the server software you’re using. Upon starting up the server, it should open up ports over UDP whilst still allowing you to use the server jar you desire.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: If your server automatically redownloads jars upon startup, such as with an autoupdate system, this workaround will not work. Please contact your host if this does not work for you as there is nothing we can do.\n\nStuck on “Locating Server” with no errors\n\nYou may need to update your Java version. If so, update at Adoptium.net.\n\nSometimes this happens in poor-network environments. There is an mtu option in the Geyser config; lower this number slowly (in batches of 100), restart each time, and re-test joining.\n\nThis option will most likely not help if you are getting “Unable to Connect to World” with no console logs indicating a connection.\n\nLogin Failed\n\nIf you are using a plugin version: in your Geyser config, set your remote address to 127.0.0.1. If that does not work, check your startup log for a message about Docker, and use that address in the remote address\n\nCannot reply to EncryptionRequestPacket without profile and access token\n\nThere are two causes of this message:\n\nFloodgate issue:\n\nThis message can occur with a Floodgate setup. Usually, it means that a misconfiguration occurred, or another plugin is conflicting. If you copied the Floodgate key from its folder to the Geyser folder on the same server, this is now unnecessary and you can safely remove the Geyser copy, restart, and try again.\n\nServer is in Online Mode while Geyser is in Offline Mode:\n\nIf you have your configuration set up like this, put simply, it won’t work. If authentication for the Java server is set to online, it is expected Geyser is configured the same way. The server requires a valid Minecraft: Java Edition account, and if you aren’t logging into one with Geyser, then you will be unable to join the server. If your configuration is set up properly and you’re still getting this issue, it could be that your credentials are invalid.\n\nConnection Refused: &lt;INSERT IP AND/OR DOMAIN&gt;\n\nConnection Refused usually means that a Java server could not be found on that port, or the server denied access to the connection on a network level. \nThe latter can happen with anti-DDOS plugins such as TCPShield, but otherwise ensure that the server you’re trying to connect to is spelled correctly in the config, is up and is port forwarded correctly.\n\nIf you’re updating from an old build of Geyser, set your remote address to auto and try again.\n\nFloodgate Misconfiguration\nSee this page for more information.\n\nMissing profile key. This server requires secure profiles.\n\nSee this page.\n\nMojang Resetting Account Credentials\nThis is unfortunately something we have no control over, and is most likely the case when you’re running Geyser as a plugin on a server host or joining a friend far away from your location. If you’re running Geyser locally, this should not happen to you, but what we recommend for servers is a plugin we make called Floodgate, which allows for Bedrock clients to join your server without needing a Java Edition account. Take a look here for more information.\n\n“Invalid IP address!” from Bedrock\nThis can happen if the domain you are entering resolves to a SRV record, which Bedrock does not support. Try using the IPv4 address instead.\nAdditionally, this can happen when trying to specify both the ip and port in the ip tab - in which case, see here for how to properly connect to “test.geysermc.org:19132”.\n\nBedrock clients freeze when opening up commands for the first time\nDisable command-suggestions in your Geyser config. This will stop the freezing at the expense of removing command suggestions from Bedrock clients.\nIf you’re a dedicated server admin, you can have a list of commands players should be using. This will remove any unnecessary commands from tab completion as well for Java players. \nIt has other benefits too. Here’s a plugin that can just do that: \nCommandWhitelist. Alternatively, use the HideCommands Geyser extension to hide commands just for Bedrock players.\n\nFailed to load locale asset cache: Unrecognized token ‘Cannot’\nThis or anything else related to failing to download a locale file on startup is usually caused by java trying to connect using IPv6 and Mojang only use IPv4, so start Geyser or the server up with this flag -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true, EG: java -Xms1024M -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar Geyser.jar\n\nOutdated client! Please use 1.x.x\n\nThe server is too new or Geyser is outdated. Make sure you’re on the latest Geyser.\n\nOutdated server! I’m still on 1.x.x\n\nUpdate the server or ask them to install ViaVersion. You can also try VIAaaS (ViaVersion as a Service).\n\nQuery: Incorrect Magic!\n\nSee here: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/query-incorrect-magic-and-high-cpu-usage.159386/#post-2709057\n\n\n  If you don’t use a reverse proxy such as TCPShield make sure that enable-proxy-protocol is set to false.\n\n\nOnly for BungeeCord with floodgate\n\nIf you use floodgate ensure that it is installed on all of your Spigot backend servers as following:\n\n\n  Bungee: Geyser and Floodgate\n  Lobby: floodgate\n  Server-1: floodgate\n  Server-2: floodgate\n\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\n  Please also make sure that you have the same key.pem and config.yml on all of your servers.\n\n\nIf your players can’t connect from the lobby to another backend server, check console.\n\nPlugins that can cause issues\n\n  HamsterAPI"

The easiest is using a json file but you can also use a Geyser extension.\n\nIt should be noted that blocks and their associated components are not very stable. Mojang tends to make changes to these much more often than they do for items. This means that any components Geyser allows you to register are liable to break in future versions of Bedrock.\n\nEnabling custom blocks\n\nBefore beginning, ensure that add-non-bedrock-items is set to true in your config.yml file.\n\n# Whether to add any items and blocks which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition.\n# This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the \"transfer packet\" style of server switching.\n# If this is disabled, furnace minecart items will be mapped to hopper minecart items.\n# Geyser's block, item, and skull mappings systems will also be disabled.\n# This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.\nadd-non-bedrock-items: true\n\n\nJSON mappings\n\nThe JSON mappings use a similar structure to that of behavior packs registering blocks.

						"content": "Custom items with Geyser\n\nTo setup custom items in geyser, you have to choose how you are going to register your items. The easiest is using a json file but you can also use a Geyser extension.\n\nJSON mappings\n\n\n  Start your server, and you should have a folder called custom_mappings that is created. That would be with the folder of Geyser.jar file for standalone and inside your Geyser data folder for a plugin.\n  Create a .json file, it can be any name you like and as many files as you like. You don’t need to make one file per item. Here is the structure of the file:\n    {\n \"format_version\": 1,\n \"items\": {\n\n }\n}\n    \n  \n  Inside the items entry, you can add your java item to extend:\n\n\n\"minecraft:JAVA_ITEM\": [\n\n]\n\n\n  Inside this java item, goes an array of all your custom items.\n\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"my_item\"\n}\n\n\n  Then, you need to set one or more item options or registrations, they can be stacked, so that all of the specified types need to match.\n    \n      Custom model data: custom_model_data (int)\n      Damage predicate: damage_predicate (int) This is a fractional value of damage/max damage and not a number between 0 and 1.\n      Unbreakable: unbreakable (boolean)\n    \n  \n  You also have some extra modifiers that you can set to further customise your item. Note that the following modifiers are NOT required.\n    \n      display_name (string) default: item name\n      icon (string) default: item name\n      allow_offhand (boolean) default: false\n      texture_size (int) default: 16\n      render_offsets (object) It works as follows. Note that all the sub-objects are optional, except x, y and z. You can have for example only a main hand with a position, and noting else. default: no render offset\n         \"render_offsets\": {\n  \"main_hand\": {\n      \"first_person\": {\n          \"position\": {\n              \"x\": 0,\n              \"y\": 0,\n              \"z\": 0\n          },\n          \"rotation\": {\n              \"x\": 0,\n              \"y\": 0,\n              \"z\": 0\n          },\n          \"scale\": {\n              \"x\": 0,\n              \"y\": 0,\n              \"z\": 0\n          }\n      },\n      \"third_person\": {\n\n      }\n  },\n  \"off_hand\": {\n\n  }\n }\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nGeyser extensions\n\nExtending a vanilla item\n\n\n  Create your custom item options or registrations, to which you can add any of the following. They can be stacked, so that all of the specified types need to match, but you do NOT need all of them.\n    CustomItemOptions itemOptions = CustomItemOptions.builder()\n     .customModelData(1)\n     .damagePredicate(1) //This is a fractional value of damage/max damage and not a number between 0 and 1.\n     .unbreakable(true)\n     .build();\n    \n  \n  Create your custom item, and store it somewhere:\n    CustomItemData data = CustomItemData.builder()\n     .name(\"my_item\")\n     .customItemOptions(itemOptions)\n     .build();\n    \n  \n  You have some modifiers that you can set to further customise your item. Note that the following modifiers are NOT required.\n    .displayName(\"displayName\"); //Default: item name\n.icon(\"my_icon\"); //Default: item name\n.allowOffhand(false); //Default: false\n.textureSize(16); //Default: 16\n.renderOffsets(new CustomRenderOffsets(...)); //Default: no render offset\n    \n  \n  Then, in your pre init event, you can register your item:\n    @Subscribe\npublic void onGeyserPreInitializeEvent(GeyserDefineCustomItemsEvent event) {\n event.registerCustomItem(\"minecraft:JAVA_ITEM\", data);\n}\n    \n  \n\n\nNon vanilla (modded) items with Geyser extensions (for example to use with Fabric)\n\n\n  Create your item data:\n    NonVanillaCustomItemData data = NonVanillaCustomItemData.builder()\n     .name(\"my_item\")\n     .identifier(\"my_mod:my_item\")\n     .javaId(1)\n    \n  \n  There are many other options you can set to match the behavior that you require for your item. You can see them here\n  Register your item in the GeyserDefineCustomItems event:\n    @Subscribe\npublic void onGeyserDefineCustomItemsEvent(GeyserDefineCustomItemsEvent event) {\n event.register(data);\n}\n    \n  \n\n\nResource pack\n\n\n  Setup a basic bedrock resource pack. If you need help, you can find it here.\n  Make a textures folder.\n  Create item_texture.json in the textures, and put this in it:\n\n\n{\n  \"resource_pack_name\": \"MY_PACK_NAME_HERE\",\n  \"texture_name\": \"atlas.items\",\n  \"texture_data\": {\n    \n  }\n}\n\n\n  Inside texture data, you can add your items. The texture name and path must match the name that you set in your mappings.\n\n\n\"my_item\": {\n    \"textures\": [\n        \"textures/items/my_item\"\n    ]\n}\n\n\n  Then you need to put your textures inside the textures/items. Make sure to have it match the texture path that you specified in item_texture.json!"

					"geyser-custom-skulls": {
						"id": "geyser-custom-skulls",
						"title": "Custom skulls with Geyser",
						"url": "/geyser/custom-skulls/",
						"content": "Custom skulls with Geyser\n\nUnlike Java Edition, Bedrock does not have native support for custom skull items. As a result, any method to display custom skulls with Geyser is, to some extent, a workaround. Geyser has long supported in-world custom skulls via the spawning of player entities. This, however, does not allow for the use of custom skulls in inventories, nor does it allow them to be worn by entities. To resolve this, Geyser now allows for the pre-registration of custom skulls via a config file. Geyser will then use this config file to generate a custom resource pack on start that contains the geometry and textures for the pre-registered custom skulls. To the client, these skulls are blocks. Therefore, they can be held in player inventories. In additional, attachables are defined for each skull block so that it is displayed correctly when worn and held by entities.\n\nTo setup custom skulls in geyser, you have to choose how you are going to register your blocks. The easiest is using custom-skulls.yml but you can also use a Geyser extension.\n\nEnabling custom skulls\n\nTo enable custom skulls, you must set add-non-bedrock-items to true in the config.yml file. This will enable the generation of the custom resource pack and the translation of custom skulls to custom blocks. You can then add custom skulls to the custom-skulls.yml file.\n\n# Whether to add any items and blocks which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition.\n# This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the \"transfer packet\" style of server switching.\n# If this is disabled, furnace minecart items will be mapped to hopper minecart items.\n# Geyser's block, item, and skull mappings systems will also be disabled.\n# This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.\nadd-non-bedrock-items: true\n\n\ncustom-skulls.yml\n\nThe configuration file custom-skulls.yml is present in Geyser’s configuration folder and is laid out as follows:\n\n# --------------------------------\n# Geyser Custom Skull Configuration Files\n#\n# This file is ignored with `add-custom-skull-blocks` disabled.\n# See `config.yml` for the main set of configuration values\n#\n# Custom skulls with the player username, UUID, or texture specified in this file\n# will be translated as custom blocks and be displayed in the inventory and on entities.\n# --------------------------------\n\n# Java player usernames\n# Skins will be updated when Geyser starts and players will have to re-download\n# the resource pack if any players had changed their skin.\nplayer-usernames:\n  - GeyserMC\n\n# Java player UUIDs\n# Skins will be updated when Geyser starts and players will have to re-download\n# the resource pack if any players had changed their skin.\nplayer-uuids:\n  - 8b8d8e8f-2759-47c6-acb5-5827de8a72b8\n\n# The long string of characters found in the NBT of custom player heads\nplayer-profiles:\n  - ewogICJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiIDogMTY1NzMyMjIzOTgzMywKICAicHJvZmlsZUlkIiA6ICJjZGRiZTUyMGQwNDM0YThiYTFjYzlmYzkyZmRlMmJjZiIsCiAgInByb2ZpbGVOYW1lIiA6ICJBbWJlcmljaHUiLAogICJ0ZXh0dXJlcyIgOiB7CiAgICAiU0tJTiIgOiB7CiAgICAgICJ1cmwiIDogImh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYTkwNzkwYzU3ZTE4MWVkMTNhZGVkMTRjNDdlZTJmN2M4ZGUzNTMzZTAxN2JhOTU3YWY3YmRmOWRmMWJkZTk0ZiIsCiAgICAgICJtZXRhZGF0YSIgOiB7CiAgICAgICAgIm1vZGVsIiA6ICJzbGltIgogICAgICB9CiAgICB9CiAgfQp9\n\n# The hash of the skin on Minecraft's skin server\nskin-hashes:\n  - a90790c57e181ed13aded14c47ee2f7c8de3533e017ba957af7bdf9df1bde94f\n\n\nPlayer usernames\n\nSkulls can be registered in this section via player usernames. These will be updated when Geyser starts. As a result, they may change if the player’s username or skin changes.\n\nPlayer UUIDs\n\nSkulls can be registered in this section via player UUIDs. These will be updated when Geyser starts. As a result, they may change if skin changes.\n\nPlayer profiles\n\nSkulls can be registered in this section via the texture string found in the NBT of custom player heads. Unless the value is changed manually, these will not be updated when Geyser starts. As a result, they will not change if the player’s username or skin changes. The data is simply base64 encoded JSON. For instance, the example given in the config decodes as follows:\n\n{\n  \"timestamp\" : 1657322239833,\n  \"profileId\" : \"cddbe520d0434a8ba1cc9fc92fde2bcf\",\n  \"profileName\" : \"Amberichu\",\n  \"textures\" : {\n    \"SKIN\" : {\n      \"url\" : \"http://textures.minecraft.net/texture/a90790c57e181ed13aded14c47ee2f7c8de3533e017ba957af7bdf9df1bde94f\",\n      \"metadata\" : {\n        \"model\" : \"slim\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nIf on a paper server, this data can be obtained for a skull by holding the item in hand, and running the command /paper dumpitem. This will output the NBT data of the item to chat and console. The texture string is found in the SkullOwner tag, under the Properties tag, under the textures tag, under the Value tag. For example:\n\n[05:58:07 INFO]: .KastleFirefox issued server command: /paper dumpitem\n[05:58:07 INFO]: minecraft:player_head{display: {Name: '{\"text\":\"Test\"}'}, SkullOwner: {Properties: {textures: [{Value: \"ewogICJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiIDogMTY1NzMyMjIzOTgzMywKICAicHJvZmlsZUlkIiA6ICJjZGRiZTUyMGQwNDM0YThiYTFjYzlmYzkyZmRlMmJjZiIsCiAgInByb2ZpbGVOYW1lIiA6ICJkYXZjaG9vIiwKICAidGV4dHVyZXMiIDogewogICAgIlNLSU4iIDogewogICAgICAidXJsIiA6ICJodHRwOi8vdGV4dHVyZXMubWluZWNyYWZ0Lm5ldC90ZXh0dXJlL2E5MDc5MGM1N2UxODFlZDEzYWRlZDE0YzQ3ZWUyZjdjOGRlMzUzM2UwMTdiYTk1N2FmN2JkZjlkZjFiZGU5NGYiLAogICAgICAibWV0YWRhdGEiIDogewogICAgICAgICJtb2RlbCIgOiAic2xpbSIKICAgICAgfQogICAgfQogIH0KfQ\"}]}, Id: [I; -229048314, -553040501, -1407961158, 465313087]}}\n\n\nSkin Hashes\n\nSkulls can be registered in this section via the hash of the skin on Minecraft’s skin server. This is found at the end of the URL. For example, in the URL http://textures.minecraft.net/texture/a90790c57e181ed13aded14c47ee2f7c8de3533e017ba957af7bdf9df1bde94f the hash is a90790c57e181ed13aded14c47ee2f7c8de3533e017ba957af7bdf9df1bde94f.Unless the value is changed manually, these will not be updated when Geyser starts. As a result, they will not change if the player’s username or skin changes.\n\nThis can be obtained by decoding the base64 data obtained from a player profile.\n\nGeyser extensions\n\nIn this example, we will register a custom skull from a player profile. We will use the player profile from the example above.\n\nFirst, create a class that implements Geyser’s Extension class:\n\npublic class RegisterCustomSkull implements Extension {\n    //...\n}\n\n\nNext, create a method to register your blocks in the GeyserDefineCustomSkullsEvent:\n\npublic class RegisterCustomSkull implements Extension {\n    @Subscribe\n    public void onDefineCustomSkulls(GeyserDefineCustomSkullsEvent event) {\n        //...\n    }\n}\n\n\nFinally, register your skull in the event. Use the enum SkullTextureType to specify that the value being passed is a player profile:\n\npublic class RegisterCustomSkull implements Extension {\n    @Subscribe\n    public void onDefineCustomSkulls(GeyserDefineCustomSkullsEvent event) {\n        String profile = \"ewogICJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiIDogMTY1NzMyMjIzOTgzMywKICAicHJvZmlsZUlkIiA6ICJjZGRiZTUyMGQwNDM0YThiYTFjYzlmYzkyZmRlMmJjZiIsCiAgInByb2ZpbGVOYW1lIiA6ICJkYXZjaG9vIiwKICAidGV4dHVyZXMiIDogewogICAgIlNLSU4iIDogewogICAgICAidXJsIiA6ICJodHRwOi8vdGV4dHVyZXMubWluZWNyYWZ0Lm5ldC90ZXh0dXJlL2E5MDc5MGM1N2UxODFlZDEzYWRlZDE0YzQ3ZWUyZjdjOGRlMzUzM2UwMTdiYTk1N2FmN2JkZjlkZjFiZGU5NGYiLAogICAgICAibWV0YWRhdGEiIDogewogICAgICAgICJtb2RlbCIgOiAic2xpbSIKICAgICAgfQogICAgfQogIH0KfQ\"\n        event.registerCustomSkull(profile, SkullTextureType.PROFILE);\n    }\n}\n\n\nScraping custom skulls from a world\n\nCustom skulls can be extracted from an existing world for easy implementation via mappings or API using the tool HeadExtractor made by Amberichu.

						"content": "Geyser Events\nGeyser has a powerful event system that allows you to listen to events that are sent by Geyser. Events are at the heart of Geyser Extensions, and can be used by plugins and mods as well.\n\nFull documentation can be found here.\n\nEvent Categories\nTo use events in a Spigot/Paper plugin or a Fabric mod, you need to register the Geyser Event Bus as a listener and then subscribe to the events you want to listen to.\nExtensions can use the @Subscribe annotation.\n\nEvents are categorized into the following categories:\n\n  Bedrock: Events that are sent for each connecting Bedrock client,\nfor example the ClientEmoteEvent that is sent when a Bedrock player uses an emote - or the SessionLoginEvent that is sent when a Bedrock player logged in and is about to join a server.\n  Java: Events that are sent for the java server, for example\nthe ServerDefineCommandsEvent - it is fired when the Java sends the commands to show for Bedrock players.\n  Connection: Connection-related events, such as a ping event to return e.g. a custom MOTD.\n  Lifecycle: Events that are sent during Geyser’s lifecycle, such as the loading of custom items, resource packs, or Geyser commands.\n\n\nTo see all the events in the respective categories, click on the links above.\n\nUsage Examples:\n\nEach method that you want to subscribe to an event needs to be annotated with the @Subscribe annotation (from the GeyserMC events package).\n@Subscribe\npublic void onGeyserLoadResourcePacksEvent(GeyserLoadResourcePacksEvent event) {\n    logger().info(\"Loading: \" + event.resourcePacks().size() + \" resource packs.\");\n    // you could add a resource pack with event.resourcePacks().add(path-to-pack)\n}\n\nIf you wish to listen to events in a Spigot/Paper plugin or a Fabric mod, you need to register the Geyser Event Bus as a listener first. Just make sure you implement EventRegistrar in the main class of your mod or plugin.\nExtensions do not need to do that - they are automatically registered, so a simple @Subscribe annotation is enough.\n\nFabric mod example:\npublic class ExampleMod implements ModInitializer, EventRegistrar {\n    public static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"modid\");\n    \n    @Override \n    public void onInitialize() {\n        ServerLifecycleEvents.SERVER_STARTING.register((server) -&gt; {\n            GeyserApi.api().eventBus().register(this, ExampleMod.class); // register your mod &amp; this class as a listener\n        });\n        \n        LOGGER.info(\"Geyser is cool!\");\n    }\n    \n    // here an event, we subscribe as usual with the @Subscribe annotation\n    @Subscribe \n    public void onGeyserPostInitializeEvent(GeyserPostInitializeEvent eventad {\n        LOGGER.info(\"Geyser started!\");\n    }\n}\n\n\n    Do note: We cannot directly register the event bus in the mod initializer, since the Geyser API would not be loaded yet.\n\n\nTherefore, we register it in the server starting event provided by the Fabric API.\n\nPaper/Spigot plugin example:\n\n\n  In your plugin.yml, add the following lines:\n      depend: [\"Geyser-Spigot\"]\n    \n    This ensures that your plugin loads after Geyser has, so the Geyser API would be available.\n  \n  In your main class, implement the EventRegistrar interface and register the event bus in the onEnable method:\n    public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin implements EventRegistrar {\n    \n @Override\n public void onEnable(){\n     getLogger().info(\"Registering Geyser event bus!\");\n     GeyserApi.api().eventBus().register(this, this); // register your plugin &amp; this class as a listener\n }\n\n // here an event, we subscribe as usual with the @Subscribe annotation\n @Subscribe\n public void onGeyserPostInitializeEvent(GeyserPostInitializeEvent event) {\n     getLogger().info(\"Geyser started!\");\n }\n}\n    \n  \n  If you want to provide your event with a consumer, rather than annotating it, you can also manually subscribe your method to the event bus:\n    // replace GeyserEvent.class with the event class you want to listen to\nGeyserApi.api().eventBus().subscribe(this, GeyserEvent.class, this::yourMethod);\n    \n  \n\n\nEvent Priority\nEvents can have a priority, which is used to determine the order in which the listeners are called. The default priority is NORMAL.\nTo (optionally) set the priority of your event listener, you can add the priority to the @Subscribe annotation:\n@Subscribe(postOrder = PostOrder.EARLY)\n\nIf you do not specify a priority, the default priority is used. For all available priorities, see\nhere."

						"title": "Geyser Extensions",
						"url": "/geyser/extensions/",
						"content": "Geyser Extensions\nGeyser Extensions are the equivalent of “plugins”, but specifically for the Geyser platform. This brings the advantage of them being platform-agnostic, meaning that you won’t have to worry about supporting all platforms individually. Additionally, they will be, by design, only applied for Bedrock players joining via Geyser.\n\nWhat can Geyser Extensions do?\nExtensions can fully utilize the Geyser API to add additional functionality to Geyser. See Geyser API docs for info on what is currently possible. To name a few examples:\n\n  Register custom items and blocks\n  Hide commands from being suggested\n  Change the MOTD\n  Register your own commands\n  Listen to events, e.g. the emote event.\n\n\nThe underlying Geyser API is steadily expanding, creating more and more opportunities.\n\nWhich Geyser Extensions exist?\nAt the moment, extensions are still a new system, so there is only a small list of known extensions for Geyser. However, new extensions are always being created!\nThere is an official list of available extensions you can check out. If you have an extension you’d like to see on this list, feel free to open a PR!\n\nInstalling Extensions\nTo install an extension, simply put the extension .jar file into Geyser’s ‘extensions’ folder. Then, restart Geyser (or the server Geyser runs on).\n\nCreating Geyser Extensions\nThe easiest way to create an extension would be utilizing this official template. Simply create a new repository from the template, customize the ‘extension.yml’ &amp; ‘settings.gradle’ files, and get started making the extension.\n\nGeyser recognizes extensions when they have a file called ‘extension.yml’ in the jars ‘resources’ folder.\n\nextension.yml:\nid: exampleid\nname: ExampleExtension\nmain: org.geyser.extension.exampleid.ExampleExtension\napi: 1.0.0\nversion: 1.0.0\nauthors: [ExampleAuthor]\n\n\nExplanations for the individual fields:\n\n  id: The id of the extension. Every extension needs to have their unique id - all lowercase letters. If you e.g. register a command for your extension, it will have the id as a prefix: e.g. ‘/exampleid command’.\n  name: The name of the extension.\n  main: The main class of your extension.\n  api: The Base API version your extension targets.\n  authors: The author(s) of the extension. To add more than one entry, separate entries with a comma.\n\n\nCreating the main class\n\nThe main class, the entrypoint for the extension, needs to implement the ‘Extension’ interface provided by Geyser. \nThat way, Geyser recognizes the extension, and gives you access to important methods - such as ‘logger()’, to get your extensions logger. \nTo see all the methods provided by that interface, see here.\n\nUnlike plugins, extensions do not have a ‘onEnable’ or ‘onDisable’ method. Instead, most actions are done in events at different stages during Geyser’s lifecycle using events.\nSome important ones are:\n\n  GeyserPreInitializeEvent: This event is fired when Geyser starts to initialize. If you e.g. need to register extension commands that are configured in your config, \nyou would need to load the config here to ensure that your config is ready before the GeyserDefineCommandsEvent is fired.\n  GeyserPostInitializeEvent: It is called when Geyser has completed initializing. The bulk of your code should go here, as the GeyserAPI is fully available at this stage.\n  GeyserShutdownEvent: Called when Geyser is shutting down. You can use this to e.g. save data, or clean up resources.\n\n\nSee below for an example:\n@Subscribe\npublic void onPostInitialize(GeyserPostInitializeEvent event) {\n    // example: show that your extension is loading.\n    this.logger().info(\"Loading example extension...\");\n}\n\nIf you wish to register custom items, global resource packs (or soon, custom blocks and entities), you will need to subscribe to the event using the @Subscribe annotation,\nand register them in the event. You can find an example for custom items here. For other events, see here for documentation.\n\nTo build your extension, run the Gradle build task, and install the extension.\n\nCreating commands with Geyser Extensions\nTo create a command, you would need to use the “Commands” package in the Geyser API. Brief rundown:\n\n  Command.java\nThis interface represents a command in Geyser - to make one, you can use the CommandBuilder. You can register it with the\nGeyserDefineCommandsEvent\n  CommandExecutor.java\nThis interface represents a command execute handler in Geyser, and extends the CommandSource interface.\n  CommandSource.java\nThis interface represents a command source in Geyser. It can be used to e.g. send messages to the source, check if the source has permission to execute a command, or get the locale.\n\n\nCommand command = Command.builder(this) // \"this\" is the extension's main class\n        .name(\"ExampleCommand\")\n        .bedrockOnly(true)\n        .source(CommandSource.class)\n        .aliases(List.of(\"example\", \"ex\"))\n        .description(\"An example command\")\n        .executableOnConsole(false) \n        .suggestedOpOnly(false)\n        .permission(\"example.command\")\n        .executor((source, cmd, args) -&gt; {\n            // this is the command executor - this is where you would put your code to execute the command.\n            // source is the source that executed the command\n            // cmd is the command that was executed\n            // args are the arguments passed to the command\n            source.sendMessage(\"Hello World\");\n        })\n        .build();\n\n\nTo register the command, you would need to subscribe to the GeyserDefineCommandsEvent, and register the command there:\n@Subscribe\npublic void onDefineCommands(GeyserDefineCommandsEvent event) {\n    event.register(command);\n}\n\nIf everything went right, you should be able to execute the command in-game by running “/extesionid [command]” - in our case, “/exampleid examplecommand”.\nHere, it would send “Hello World” to the source that ran the command.\nSince we also set aliases, you could also run “/exampleid example” or “/exampleid ex” for the same command.\nTo provide args, simple run “/exampleid examplecommand [args]” - replacing [args] with the arguments you want to pass to the command.\n\nListening to Events\nSee here for documentation. You do not need to register the event listener, Geyser will do that for you.\n\n\n\nFacing troubles with extensions?\n\n  Make sure you are using the latest version of Geyser - older versions might not have the latest API changes.\n  Add debug prints.\n  Ask in the #development channel in the Geyser Discord server."

With this being said, it emulates a Minecraft: Java Edition client, so the server actually thinks you’re joining from Java Edition. Regardless of the server or what plugins it has installed, you can join it with Geyser (as long as the server supports the latest vanilla (unmodified) Minecraft version).\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            So, how does Redstone work?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Redstone, along with any other mechanics like commands, farms, etc., will work exactly like Java Edition since joining a Java Edition server and Geyser does not modify server behavior.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Is Geyser paid?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            No, Geyser and all related projects are completely free and open-source, licensed under the MIT license.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            What plugins don't work with Geyser?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Geyser should generally work fine with plugins, as we emulate a Java client. There are exceptions, though:\n\n\n  TCPShield requires only-allow-proxy-connections disabled without a paid plan. However, their “Premium” plan will allow the support of Geyser - please see here for setup instructions.\n\n\nFloodgate can cause issues with plugins as it modifies the login process. Please note that any offline mode authenticator plugins are only here for documentation; Geyser does not support offline mode usage.\n\n\n  DynamicBungeeAuth Currently working on latest version 10.28B+ (10.27B and older versions produces invalid credentials for Bedrock players)\n  FastLogin does not let floodgate add player prefix.\n  ExploitFixer thinks that Floodgate users are UUID spoofing - disable the uuidspoof setting in ExploitFixer’s config.\n  JPremium alters the UUID of a player, causing Floodgate not to be able to get the Bedrock data from its map.\n  LibHatesMods causes authentication to fail with com.github.steveice10.mc.auth.exception.request.InvalidCredentialsException\n  ProtocolSupport is currently incompatible with Floodgate. Works with Floodgate, but we recommend using ViaBackwards instead.\n  ProtocolSupportBungee changes how the login process works and therefore breaks the Floodgate injection code.\n  SayNoToMcLeaks prevents Floodgate from finishing its login system.\n\n\nIf you come across any more, please let us know via Discord.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            What server versions does Geyser support?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            The Geyser-Spigot plugin supports any Minecraft server version 1.13.2 or later. Any earlier version is not supported by the plugin - use a proxy version or the standalone build instead.\nSince Geyser emulates a {{ site.data.versions.java }} Java Edition client, you need to install ViaVersion on your server\nif it is not running the latest version of Minecraft. \n\nIn order for Bedrock players to chat (1.19.3+) or join (1.19.1/1.19.2), you need to disable chat signing. More information about that can be read on the chat signing page. \n\nYou will also need to run at least Java 16 or later to use Geyser. See here for more info on updating Java.\nPaper versions not supporting Java 16 can add -DPaper.IgnoreJavaVersion=true flag to the Java startup arguments to allow Paper to run on Java 16.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Which plugin version of Geyser do I need?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            This is a non-complete list of what platform each plugin version of Geyser is for, and the standalone version can be used for any as it isn’t a plugin.\n\n  Geyser-Spigot works with:\n    \n      Spigot\n      Paper (recommended)\n      Any other forks of the above\n    \n  \n  Geyser-Bungee works with:\n    \n      BungeeCord\n      Waterfall\n      Any other forks of the above\n    \n  \n  Geyser-Velocity works with Velocity\n  Geyser-Fabric works with Fabric, and requires FabricAPI to be installed on the server as well.\n\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Which type of Geyser version is better, standalone or plugin?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Because of optimizations that hook into the plugin platforms, plugin versions of Geyser are preferable compared to standalone Geyser. On Spigot, Velocity, and BungeeCord versions of Geyser, direct connections allow for faster loading times, lower latency, and accurate IP addresses without requiring Floodgate. Geyser-Spigot has further optimizations due to having direct world access, including lower memory usage and greater translation accuracy. However, large server networks might prefer standalone Geyser because it can be updated without needing to restart any other proxies or servers, and can offload resource usage onto seperate machines.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            If using BungeeCord or another fork, where do I need to put Geyser/Floodgate?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            You only need Geyser and/or Floodgate on the BungeeCord server, as long as not using the Floodgate API. In this case, Floodgate is needed on the “backend” servers as well.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            What IP do I need to give Bedrock players?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Generally, the IP that Bedrock players will join with is your Java IP and the defined port in your Geyser config in the bedrock section under port. For example, if the IP address Java players join with is test.geysermc.org, and the bedrock port is set as 19132, Bedrock players should join with the IP test.geysermc.org and port 19132.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            How can I have Bedrock players load resource packs?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            You can add Bedrock resource packs to your Geyser installation in the packs folder of wherever the Geyser config is located. Bedrock clients will automatically download and load those resource packs. There is currently no automatic Java-to-Bedrock resource pack conversion, but you can convert any Java resource pack to Bedrock using this tool and add that to your server. The converter currently only works with packs up until 1.17; you will need to use another converter, or, convert the pack yourself.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            How can Bedrock players hold items in their offhand?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            You can use the command /geyser offhand, which will swap the item in their main hand and offhand. There is also a setting you can enable in the config (emote-offhand-workaround) to allow Bedrock players to perform an emote in order to switch their main hand and offhand.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            How do I include players in commands when using Floodgate?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            If there is a prefix on Floodgate players, you must include the prefix in the name. Floodgate also replaces all spaces in names with underscores, so be sure to replace any spaces with underscores when executing the command. If this does not work, put double quotes around the name.\n\nExample: /tp \".&lt;bedrock_username&gt;\"\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            How do I add players to the whitelist when using Floodgate?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            There are three ways you can do this.\n\n\n  \n    Use Floodgate’s built-in whitelist command: /fwhitelist add &lt;bedrock_username&gt;. This will only work if the player has joined any Geyser server already.\n  \n  \n    Turn off the whitelist using /whitelist off, then get the Geyser player to join. After that, run /whitelist add \".&lt;bedrock_username&gt;\", and finally, turn the whitelist back on using /whitelist on. \nWhen using Local Linking: If you’re linking a Bedrock account to an existing whitelisted Java account, you don’t need to whitelist the Bedrock account separately. You can link the accounts and immediately turn the whitelist back on.\n  \n  \n    Add the player’s UUID, as given by Floodgate, to the whitelist.json file. Then, run /whitelist reload to update the whitelist.\n  \n\n\nChoose the method that suits your preferences and server setup.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            How do I find a player's UUID without them joining when using Floodgate?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Use this page. If this doesn’t work, then try this method:\n\nFirst, you’ll need to get the XUID of the player. There are several third-party websites to find this, for example, this one (unaffiliated with Geyser). Make sure to choose “Hexidecimal.” You’ll need to enter the player’s Xbox Gamertag, and, once submitted, it should display the XUID in the format of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. To turn the XUID into a UUID that Java Edition can recognize, you need to put the XUID in this format: 00000000-0000-0000-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. If formatted right, Java Edition should accept it as a UUID.\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Can I remove the prefix of Floodgate players?\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            While you can remove the prefix, it is generally recommended not to remove the prefix to prevent situations where player usernames are the same on both editions (Ex: Bedrock Username: JohnDoe, Java Username: JohnDoe). While they have different UUIDs, they have the same username, which may cause conflicts with commands that involve a player name.

						"url": "/geyser/fixing-unable-to-connect-to-world/",
						"content": "Fixing ‘Unable to Connect to World’ errors\nThis is by far the most common error people get when attempting to set up Geyser. Here’s some steps on how to solve it.\nUsually, this error is caused by improper configuration of Geyser, or issues with your network.\n\n\n\tIf you are using a Minecraft server hosting provider (e.g. Aternos, or Apex Hosting), you should refer to the hosting provider setup instructions on \nthe setup page. Following these will most likely resolve the issue!\n\n\nIf you are not using a Minecraft server hosting provider, carry on.\n\n\n\tTo check if your server is (theoretically) reachable on Bedrock edition, try running the following command in your server console:\n    geyser connectiontest &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;, and see what it suggests to try.\n\n\nJava Edition players can’t connect!\n\nThis should not be a Geyser problem. Geyser does not modify server behavior. Floodgate does modify the login structure, but only for Bedrock players. \nContact your hosting provider or look elsewhere for fixing this connection issue.\n\nConnecting fails after updating Geyser\n\nIf this occurred after updating a plugin version of Geyser, ensure that you shut off your server, swapped the Geyser jar, and then started up your server. \nIncase you reset your configuration file, check out the setup guide again.\n\nThere are errors in my console!\n\nPlease read through the common issues page. If there is another error not documented there, join us on our Discord.\n\nTry restarting the server and game\n\nEspecially on mobile devices, sometimes just restarting Minecraft fixes the issue.\n\nIs it the server or the client?\n\nRun your Java server IP and Bedrock address here: https://mcsrvstat.us/. It’s a great way of determining if the server is reachable in the first place. \nAdditionally, check if you can see a connection attempt in the server console. If you can’t, it’s likely a network issue.\n\nFor console players specifically: If only they can’t join, while other Bedrock players can, it is likely an issue with their console connecting method.\n\nGeneral troubleshooting steps\n\nEnsure you’re connecting on the right IP and Port\n\nYou should be connecting with the Java server IP and the Bedrock port (set in the Geyser config). If you port forwarded 19132, for example, you should specify port 19132 when connecting from Bedrock.\n\nI’m using a hosting provider or VPS!\n\nPlease read this page on supported hosting providers to see if there are extra configuration steps required for your hosting or server provider.\nSome VPS/KVM providers may require further setup, such as OVH, SoYouStart, and Oracle Cloud. Please read this note for more information.\n\nIssues using Docker or Pterodactyl\nMake sure you assign the port to pterodactyl, and on docker, to the docker compose file. See our port-forwarding page for fixes.\n\nPort forwarding issues\n\nYour server does need to be port forwarded to allow connections from outside the local network. See our port-forwarding guide for more information.\n\nUsing TCP in DNS options/port forwarding instead of UDP\n\nMinecraft: Java Edition uses TCP for connecting; Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses UDP. Port forwarding your Bedrock Edition port with only TCP will not work, it has to be UDP. Forwarding your Bedrock Edition port with TCP/UDP (both protocols) should also work but is not recommended unless Java Edition and Bedrock Edition is sharing the same port.\n\nBedrock port is less than 10000\n\nHistorically, having a Bedrock port that is a lower number will cause issues. Setting it to 10000 or above seems safe.\n\nBedrock players can connect after hitting the server on a TCP port (e.g. on Java or a website on the same server), OR only people who also play on Java Edition can join from Geyser\n\nThis is likely a firewall issue on your server. Try the following workaround:\nAttempt to connect to the Bedrock IP and port through a web browser - for example, http://test.geysermc.org:19132. It won’t work, but then try connecting through Bedrock, and it should work.\n\nSpecific host fixes for OVH/SoYouStart can be found here.\n\nChanging the bedrock address in the Geyser config.\n\nExcept for a few specific hosting providers, you generally do not need to change this part of the Geyser config. \nHowever, in rare instances, it does fix issues - for example, when Windows has multiple network adapters (check by running ipconfig in cmd), \nit can help to set the address to the local IP of the adapter you want to use.\n\nUsing a hosting provider or other location\n\nPterodactyl\n\nIf you get this error while using the Pterodactyl Panel, try editing the Geyser config and changing the port to something besides 19132 (e.g. 25566).\n\nHosting Geyser on another computer on the same network\n\nCan only connect from the same computer and not anywhere else\n\nYour firewall is likely in the way. Try adding an exception to Java, or disable the firewall for testing purposes.\n\nAs a last resort for troubleshooting…\n\nMinecraft offers a vanilla Bedrock server here. Downloading, running, and attempting to connect to it may help isolate if the issue is on Geyser’s end, or your computer/network’s end.\n\nUsing Geyser on the same computer\n\nWindows 10/11\n\nThis only affects people trying to join Geyser from Windows 10/11 Edition with Geyser hosted on the same computer.\n\nThis is an issue caused by Loopback restrictions not being lifted. By default, Microsoft Apps have this restriction on all their apps for local connections. Geyser will attempt to resolve this automatically; however, if you’re still having connection problems, you can lift it by typing the following in Windows PowerShell in administrator mode: (it should return OK. if it worked)\nCheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n=\"Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\"\n\n\nShould this not work, you can try this set of steps:\n\n\n  Hold down Windows Key + R\n  In the prompt, type hdwwiz.exe, then press Enter then Next\n  Install the Hardware Manually\n  Choose Network Adapter &gt; Next &gt; Microsoft &gt; “Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter” then hit Next until it’s done."

						"id": "geyser-forms",
						"title": "Forms and Cumulus",
						"url": "/geyser/forms/",
						"content": "What is Cumulus?\n\nBedrock Edition has a cool exclusive feature called Forms.\nCumulus is the Forms API that we use in Geyser and Floodgate.\nThe source code is available here. You can access the Cumulus API through the Floodgate API, or the Geyser API.\n\nBedrock knows three types of Forms:\n\n  ModalForm\n  SimpleForm\n  CustomForm\n\n\nWe’ll discuss them one by one starting with the easiest and ending with the least easy form type.\nAfter that, you get an overview of every single component.\nThen we’ll talk about sending the form, receiving a response and doing advanced stuff.\n\nModalForm\n\nWhile this is the easiest form type it’s also the least customisable.\nYou have a title, description (content) and two buttons.\n\n\n\nCode used in the image:\n\nModalForm.builder()\n    .title(\"Title\")\n    .content(\"Content\")\n    .button1(\"Button 1\")\n    .button2(\"Button 2\")\n\n\nSimpleForm\n\nWhile this one is less easy than ModalForm is, it also has more customizability.\nIt’s still limited to a title, content and buttons, but these buttons can also have images and do not have a minimum and maximum of two.\n\n\n\nCode used in the image:\nSimpleForm.builder()\n    .title(\"Title\")\n    .content(\"Content\")\n    .button(\"Button without an image\")\n    .button(\"Button with URL image\", FormImage.Type.URL, \"https://github.com/GeyserMC.png?size=200\")\n    .button(\"Button with path image\", FormImage.Type.PATH, \"textures/i/glyph_world_template.png\")\n\n\nCustomForm\n\nWhile the CustomForm is the last one on our list (and thus the least easy one), it also has the greatest customizability.\nThis form exists of a title, content and a list of different components e.g. label, slider and input.\nSee Components for more information about every component you can use and in which form type.\n\n\n\nCode used in the image:\n\nCustomForm.builder()\n    .title(\"Title\")\n    .dropdown(\"Text\", \"Option 1\", \"Option 2\")\n    .input(\"Input\", \"placeholder\")\n    .toggle(\"Toggle\")\n    .slider(\"Text\", 0, 10, 1, 5)\n\n\nSending a form\n\nAfter you decided which form type you want to use and finished filling in the actual content, it’s time to send the Form to the Bedrock player.\nYou can do that by calling the API and send a form to the player’s UUID and the form:\nFloodgateApi.getInstance().sendForm(uuid, form); // or #sendForm(uuid, formBuilder)\n\nOr you can do it by using the Player’s FloodgatePlayer instance:\nFloodgatePlayer player = FloodgateApi.getInstance().getPlayer(uuid);\nplayer.sendForm(form); // or #sendForm(formBuilder)\n\nSo you can make and send forms in a pretty compact way by doing something like this:\nFloodgatePlayer player = FloodgateApi.getInstance().getPlayer(uuid);\n...\nplayer.sendForm(\n    CustomForm.builder()\n        .title(\"My cool title\")\n        .label(\"10/10 content\")\n);\n\n\nReceiving a response from the client\n\nIt’s nice and all that we can send forms to a client, but we also want to be able to get a response from a client and being able to handle them.\nWe can do that using one (or multiple) result handers. The most used result handlers are: validResultHandler(BiConsumer&lt;Form, ValidFormResponseResult&gt; | Consumer&lt;ValidFormResponseResult&gt;), invalidResultHandler, closedResultHandler and closedOrInvalidResultHandler.\nHere follows an example that uses result handlers:\nCustomForm.builder()\n    .title(\"geyser.auth.login.form.details.title\")\n    .label(\"geyser.auth.login.form.details.desc\")\n    .input(\"geyser.auth.login.form.details.email\", \"account@geysermc.org\", \"\")\n    .input(\"geyser.auth.login.form.details.pass\", \"123456\", \"\")\n    .closedOrInvalidResultHandler(() -&gt; buildAndShowLoginDetailsWindow(session))\n    .validResultHandler(response -&gt; session.authenticate(response.next(), response.next())));\n\n\nAdvanced stuff\n\nThe FormBuilder also has support for translating the data used in the builder.\nTo add a translator, you can use the translator(BiFunction&lt;String, String, String&gt;) or the translator(BiFunction&lt;String, String, String&gt;, String) method:\nModalForm form = ModalForm.builder()\n    .translator(this::translate, userLanguage)\n    .title(\"Title\")\n    .content(\"Content\")\n    .button1(\"translate.button1\")\n    .button2(\"translate.button2\")\n    .build();\n\npublic String translate(String key, String locale) {\n    // this method will be called for every string, in this case, 4 times:\n    // Title, Content, translate.button1, translate.button2\n    // your own translate logic here\n    // return the value that replaces the key\n}\n\nOr you can have the translate method directly in the FormBuilder instead of a separate method:\nModalForm form = ModalForm.builder()\n    .translator((key, unused) -&gt; {\n        // this method will be called for every string, in this case, 4 times:\n        // Title, Content, translate.button1, translate.button2\n        // since this isn't a separate method, you don't need the locale argument, so it's unused.\n        // your own translate logic here\n        // return the value that replaces the key\n    })\n    .title(\"Title\")\n    .content(\"Content\")\n    .button1(\"translate.button1\")\n    .button2(\"translate.button2\")\n    .build();"

Only disable them if you know what you are doing. \n\n\n\n  -DGeyser.PrintSecureChatInformation=true\n    \n      Allows you to disable the warning about secure chat being disabled. \nSince the warning is sent when the server sends the warning, this option does not do much anymore.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.ShowScoreboardLogs=true\n    \n      Allows you to disable warnings related to scoreboards, such as “Tried to update score without the existence of its requested objective”.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.ShowResourcePackLengthWarning=true\n    \n      Allows you to disable the warning about a resource pack having too long paths. Disabling this warning will not fix the underlying issue! \nConsole players might not be able to join your server at all if you have a resource pack with paths exceeding the 80 character limit.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.PrintPingsInDebugMode=true\n    \n      Controls if pings are being logged in debug mode.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.UseDirectAdapters=true\n    \n      Allows you to disable the usage of NMS adapters. Disabling will result in a performance penalty and should only be used for debugging.\nThis is Spigot-only and will not work on other platforms.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.BedrockNetworkThreads=8\n    \n      Allows you to set the number of threads used for the Bedrock networking. This is not set to a specific number by default, but is instead calculated based on the available resources.\n    \n  \n  -DGeyser.AddTeamSuggestions=true\n    \n      Allows you to turn off suggestions for teams in the scoreboard command. This is enabled by default, disabling this can help with performance if there are a lot of teams defined. \nSetting “command-suggestions” to false in the config will also disable this.\n    \n  \n\n\nGeyser-Standalone specific options:\n\n--config [file]\n\n  Alias: -c\n  Points to an alternative config file to use.\n\n\n--gui / --nogui\n\n  Alias: gui / nogui:\n  Forces GUI or non-GUI usage, depending on context.\n\n\nOverriding specific config values\nOverriding a standard config option (e.g. command-suggestions):\n\n--command-suggestions=false\n\nOverriding a nested config option(e.g. the remote section with address):\n\n--remote.address=test.geysermc.org"

The source code of the Global API is available here and the source code of the Global Linking server is available here.\n\nAs a user of the API, you can get various info about Geyser (or specifically, Floodgate players) that joined any Geyser + Floodgate server before. This includes:\n\n  Conversion methods from a Bedrock gamertag to Bedrock xuid, and vice-versa. Only provides info for players who are in Geyser’s cache. \nIf you need them for all players, you can use a third-party API, e.g. https://mcprofile.io/endpoints, which also provides info from the Geyser Global API.\n  Skin info: Whenever a Bedrock player joins via Floodgate, their skin gets converted &amp; uploaded to mineskin. If you want to grab that converted skin, use the xuid of the Bedrock player in this endpoint to get a texture id, or a base64 encoded “value”, which you could use directly in e.g. player heads.\n\n\nSee the Global API docs for more info, and detailed usage.\n\nExamples\nHere are a few examples of how you could use the Global API. \n\nGeyserDiscordBot\n\n  GeyserMC’s discord bot has a /uuid command to get a floodgate uuid from a bedrock username. \n\n\nCustomPlayerHeads\n\n  A fabric mod that uses the Global API to get a Bedrock player’s skin, and then uses that to create a player head."

It will open the login site in the browser - create an account &amp; sign in. Or, use a guest account.\n  Once logged in, make sure to connect the program + site, until step 4 is reached. This should happen automatically, if it does not, follow the instructions on the website and the playit.gg program console.\n\n  Click “Create Tunnel” if you see the screen above, or, select the “Tunnels” tab when logged in to your account. There, select “Minecraft Bedrock”, leave “Enable Tunnel” ticked, and click “Add tunnel”.\n\n  Once “Add tunnel” is clicked, it should create a new tunnel, and you are set! Scroll down until you see this:\n\nIf you have Geyser running on a port that is not 19132, update the port there. The “Local Address” does not need to be changed unless you are not running playit.gg and Geyser on the same device.\n  Connect to your server - use the IP and Port from the “Allocation” tab. In our example - “180.ip.ply.gg” as the IP, and “17019” as the port. Alternatively, use the Domain it gives you instead of the IP.\n  If you join successfully, then you are done! Make sure to leave the playit.gg program running as closing it will close the tunnel. You also may want to ratelimit individual connections - use the “Per Connection Rate Limit” option to do so.\n(If you failed to join, check out the troubleshooting section of the page.)\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nI can’t connect to my server!\n\n  Are there errors in your minecraft server console?\n  Make sure to check here beforehand.\n  If you changed the port that Geyser would bind to, you’ll have to tell playit.gg to use that port instead! See step 5 here.\n  (Alternatively: You can try setting the bedrock port in the Geyser configuration to 19132.)"

					"geyser-port-forwarding": {
						"id": "geyser-port-forwarding",
						"title": "Port forwarding",
						"url": "/geyser/port-forwarding/",
						"content": "Port forwarding\nThis page contains information on how to set up port forwarding required for Geyser to work when self-hosting.\nThere are also guides for specific configurations, such as Docker/Pterodactyl, or on specific VPS/KVM providers, such as OVH or Oracle Cloud.\n\n\n\tIf you are using a Minecraft server hosting provider (e.g. Aternos, or Apex Hosting), you should refer to the hosting provider setup on the setup page instead.\n\n\nPort forwarding on Linux/Windows/macOS\nTo allow others to play on your server, you will need to set up port forwarding on the device hosting Geyser.\nAdditionally, you will need to port forward the port on your router/modem (in other words, allow and route traffic on that port to the proper machine) if you want the server to be accessible outside your own home network. \nSee here or here for helpful guides.\nDo note: if you do not have a static IP address, your IP address may change over time.\n\n\n\tSome ISPs (Internet Service Providers) block certain ports, or don't allow you to open ports (e.g. by using CGNAT, which doesn't allow you to open a port with a dynamic IP).\nOther ISPs may require you to pay extra for a static IP address. \nAs an alternative to port forwarding, you can use playit.gg to create a tunnel.\n\n\nWindows\nTo open a port on Windows, you will need to open the port through the Windows Firewall. There are multiple ways to do this:\n\n\n  \n    Powershell (recommended)\n\n    To open a port on UDP (in our example, port 19132), run the following command in an administrator Powershell:\n    New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Geyser\" -Direction Inbound -Protocol UDP -LocalPort 19132 -Action Allow\n    \n    Running this command creates a rule named “Geyser” that allows UDP traffic on port 19132.\n  \n  \n    Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (GUI)\n    \n      Search for “Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security” in the start menu, and open it. (Image)\n      Click on “Inbound Rules” in the left sidebar. (Image)\n      Click on “New Rule…” in the right sidebar. (Image)\n      Select “Port” as the rule type and click “Next”. (Example)\n      Select “UDP” and “Specific local ports”, and enter the port you want to open (in our example, 19132). Click “Next”. (Example)\n      Select “Allow the connection” and click “Next”. (Example)\n      Select the profiles you want to apply the rule to (e.g. “Domain”, “Private”, “Public”), and click “Next”. (Example)\n      Enter a name for the rule (e.g. “Geyser”), and click “Finish”. (Image)\n    \n  \n\n\nLinux\nDifferent Linux distributions, even different VPS providers ship and configure different firewalls. In the following examples, we will use 19132 as the port to open, but you should replace this with the port you are using for Geyser.\n\n\n  ufw is a simple firewall front-end for iptables that is commonly used on Ubuntu and Debian. To open a port on UDP, run the following command:\n    sudo ufw allow 19132/udp\n    \n    Then, reload the firewall with sudo ufw reload, and see all open rules with sudo ufw status. \nFurther helpful guides: DigitalOcean, Baeldung\n  \n  firewalld Add a port on UDP by running:\n    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=19132/udp\n    \n    Then, reload the firewall with sudo firewall-cmd --reload, and see all open rules with sudo firewall-cmd --list-all. \nFurther helpful guides: DigitalOcean\n  \n  iptables is a common firewall that is used on many Linux distributions. To open a port on UDP, run the following command:\n    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 19132 -j ACCEPT\n    \n    Then, save the firewall with sudo iptables-save, and see all open rules with sudo iptables -L. \nFurther helpful guides for iptables: DigitalOcean, Ubuntu\n  \n\n\nmacOS\nYou will need to disable Block all incoming connections in your Firewall settings, as that will block any connections and won’t allow you to make exceptions. \nTo allow incoming connections, click Allow when getting these prompts.\nIf you are still facing issues, see Apple’s official guide here to open a port on macOS.\n\nUsing Docker or Pterodactyl\nIn addition to port forwarding the port in your server’s firewall (and, if applicable, your router/modem), you will need to assign the port in Docker/Pterodactyl.\n\nPterodactyl\nMake sure to allocate the port to the server in the Pterodactyl panel’s Network tab, additionally to port forwarding the port. \nSee here for more information.\n\n\n\nThere are also different Geyser eggs for Pterodactyl, which can be found here.\n\n\n    If you are not able to allocate ports in the Pterodactyl panel, you will need to contact your server host to allocate one for you or try to use an existing port allocation.\n\n\nDocker\nFor Geyser to work under Docker (e.g. using Itzg’s Docker image), you will need to add the Geyser port on UDP to the docker-compose file. This is done by adding the following to the ports section:\nports:\n    - \"25565:25565\"\n    - \"19132:19132/udp\"\n\nThe additional /udp suffix is required so that the port is exposed on UDP. If you want to run the Java server and Geyser on the same port, the following would work:\nports:\n    - \"25565:25565\"\n    - \"25565:25565/udp\"\n\nAlternatively, add another port with the -p 19132:19132/udp flag to the docker run command.\n\nIssues with specific VPS/KVM providers\nSome providers, such as OVH, Oracle Cloud, and SoYouStart, have a firewall that blocks UDP ports by default/in most cases.\n\nOVH and SoYouStart\nBy default, OVHs firewall requires a TCP ping to the server before allowing UDP connections. This is not possible with Geyser, so you will need to disable the firewall.\n\n\n    If you do not have access to these firewall settings, but got linked to this page, please contact your server host and provide them with this link - they are likely using OVH internally.\t\n\n\nTo verify/temporary work around it:\n\nAttempt to connect to your servers IP and port through a web browser - for example, http://test.geysermc.org:19132. Connecting won’t work, but then try connecting through Bedrock on that same device, and it should work.\nAlternatively, try connecting to the server first on Java edition, then on Bedrock with the same device.\n\nTo resolve it:\n\nOVH:\n\n  Navigate to Network interfaces\n  Click on the ... button on the table for your IP -&gt; then ... and Configure the GAME firewall -&gt; Add rule -&gt; Other protocol (or minecraftPocketEdition if available)\n  Add your Geyser port into outgoing port.\n\n\nSoYouStart (subsidiary of OVH):\n\n  Click the IP tab.\n  Click the gear at the right of the public IP address; select “Game mitigation”.\n  Pick “Add a rule”.\n  Select “minecraftPocketEdition” in the dropdown list and enter the target UDP ports.\n  Save and wait a few seconds for the changes to come into effect.\n\n\nOracle Cloud/OCI\nYou’ll need to allow port 19132 on UDP in both the security list and the firewall-cmd command.\n\nAdditional step for Ubuntu users:\n\n  Remove/comment out -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited in the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file.\n  Then, run the following command to fix ufw:\n    sudo iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4"

To run Geyser Standalone on Android or iOS, see the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\n   Geyser-Standalone is NOT a plugin or mod! It is a standalone Java program that you would run separately to your Java Edition server.\n\n\nGeneral Setup &amp; Configuration\n\n\n  Download Geyser Standalone from here.\n  Create a new folder for Geyser, and drop the jar in there.\n  Start Geyser Standalone:\n    \n      GUI (Recommended): \nDouble-click the jar file and all the necessary files for Geyser will be created.\n      Or use the console setup: \nCreate a new bat or startup script, similar to the one you’d use for a Spigot/Paper server, and take a look at this page for what to put into it. \nRun the startup script/bat, and all the necessary files for Geyser will be created.\n    \n  \n  \n    Open your Geyser config (config.yml), and find the following:\n\n    bedrock: \n   # The IP address that will listen for connections. \n   # Generally, you should only uncomment and change this if you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server. \n   #address: 0.0.0.0 \n\n   # The port that will listen for connections. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server.\n   port: 19132 \n    \n    The port is the port Bedrock players will enter to connect to the server. \nUncommenting and changing address here is only needed if you need to limit connections to a specific IP address.\n\n\n    To configure which Java Edition server Geyser Standalone will send players to, find the remote section:\n    remote:\n   # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server\n   # If it is \"auto\", for standalone version the remote address will be set to 127.0.0.1.\n   address: auto\n\n   # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server\n   port: 25565\n      \n   # Authentication type. Can be offline, online, or floodgate (see https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Floodgate).\n   auth-type: online\n    \n    Here, change address to the Java server’s address, or to auto if the server is on the same machine as Geyser-Standalone. \nThen, change port to the Java server’s port. If you have set up Floodgate on the remote Java server, you can set auth-type to “floodgate” - otherwise, \nset it to either online for an online mode server, or offline for an offline mode server. To install and set up Floodgate with a Standalone server, see here. \n  \n  \n    Connecting to your server\n \nConnecting locally in the same network \nOn the same device as the server, you can connect using localhost, or 127.0.0.1 as the address.\nDo note: When hosting and playing on the same Windows device, you will need the loopback fix.\nOther devices in the same local network can use your local IPv4 to connect - it starts with 10. or 192.168..\nAlternatively, open Minecraft: Bedrock edition, and join the LAN-Server in the Friends tab.\n \nConnecting from a different network\nYou will need to expose the port Geyser runs on to the Internet if you want players from outside your network to join.\nTo achieve that, you have two options: \n\n    \n      \n        Port forwarding: Open the Geyser port (e.g. 19132) on the UDP protocol in your router/modem, and in the Windows/Linux firewall.\nAfter doing this, players can connect with your public IPv4 + port to your server.\nSee here for a helpful guide. \n      \n      \n        playit.gg: Instead of opening a port (which might not be an option/if you do not want to expose your home ip), you can use\nthe playit.gg service to create a tunnel for you to route the traffic through. See our playit.gg guide.\nNgrok will not work since it is TCP-only. \n      \n    \n  \n  Verify whether connections from other networks are possible by running geyser connectiontest &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt; in the console.\n\n\nRunning Geyser-Standalone on Android/iOS\n\n\n   Applications such as Termux on Android are capable of running Geyser, but this largely depends on how powerful your Android device is.

					"geyser-understanding-the-config": {
						"id": "geyser-understanding-the-config",
						"title": "Understanding the Config",
						"url": "/geyser/understanding-the-config/",
						"content": "This page covers basic information about the Geyser config and what each option does. Though they are explained in the configuration itself, this explains what each option does in more detail.\n\nBedrock Section\nThe options for Geyser on the Bedrock-facing end. Mostly contains options for how Bedrock edition will see the server.\n\naddress: The address of Geyser on the Bedrock end. In most all scenarios, this should not need to be changed, unless you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server. Leave it at 0.0.0.0 (default), unless otherwise instructed in the setup guide.\n\nport: The port Geyser will run on. By default, it is 19132 in Bedrock. If you are using a server hosting provider, you may not have this port available to you - in which case, read the setup guide to proceed.\n\nclone-remote-port: Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock/UDP connections. This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server. This option does not do anything on the Standalone version of Geyser.\n\nmotd1: The first line of the MOTD for Geyser.\n\nmotd2: The second line of the MOTD for Geyser. Please keep in mind, this option will only work if Geyser is shown in the Friends tab!\n\nserver-name: The world name that is shown in the top-right area of the pause menu and the settings menu.\n\ncompression-level: An number value that represents how much to compress outgoing traffic. Can be any number from -1 to 9; any other value will be replaced with the nearest acceptable value. The higher the number, the more CPU processing that is used but with less bandwidth used. Default is 6.\n\nenable-proxy-protocol:  Whether to enable PROXY protocol or not for clients. You DO NOT WANT this feature unless you run UDP reverse proxy in front of your Geyser instance. You do NOT need this for BungeeCord (and forks), Velocity, or Waterfall.\n\nproxy-protocol-whitelisted-ips: Disabled by default, and only enable this if you use “enable-proxy-protocol”. A list of allowed PROXY protocol speaking proxy IP addresses/subnets. Should really only be used when you are not able to use a proper firewall (usually true with shared hosting providers etc.). Keeping this list empty means there is no IP address whitelist. Both IP addresses and subnets are supported.\n\nRemote Section\nOptions for the remote (Java) server.\n\naddress: The address of the Minecraft: Java Edition server you want to join. By default, this value is auto. By keeping it as auto, the address, port, and Floodgate support will be automatically configured. In standalone, keeping this as auto sets the remote address to 127.0.0.1.\n\nport: The port of the Minecraft: Java Edition server you specified in the address section. For plugin versions, if address has been set to “auto”, the port will also follow the server’s listening port.\n\nauth-type: The authentication type of the Minecraft: Java Edition server. Valid options are online, offline, and floodgate.\n\nPlease keep in mind, what you specify in the Geyser auth-type option MUST be the same as what the remote server has (with the exception of Geyser being in online mode and remote being in offline mode). You simply cannot join an online mode server without a genuine account. If you want to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition accounts to join without a Minecraft: Java Edition account, see the Floodgate wiki page.\n\nuse-proxy-protocol: Whether to enable PROXY/HAProxy protocol or not while connecting to the server. This is useful only when:\n\n  Your server supports PROXY protocol (it probably doesn’t)\n  You run Velocity or BungeeCord with its respective option enabled.\n  IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON’T TOUCH IT!\n\n\nforward-hostname: Forwards the hostname/IP address that the Bedrock client used to connect over to the Java server. This is designed to be used for forced hosts on proxies.\n\nGeneral Options\nGeneral Geyser options that are mostly specific to Geyser itself.\n\nfloodgate-key-file:  Floodgate uses encryption to ensure use from authorised sources. This should point to the public key generated by Floodgate (BungeeCord, Spigot or Velocity). You can ignore this when not using Floodgate. If you’re using a plugin version of Floodgate on the same server, the key will automatically be picked up from Floodgate.The key file path for Floodgate. Requires that you have Floodgate installed and the auth-type set to floodgate.\n\nsaved-user-logins: For online mode authentication type only. \nStores a list of Bedrock players that should have their Java Edition account saved after login.\nThis saves a token that can be reused to authenticate the player later. This does not save emails or passwords,\nbut you should still be cautious when adding to this list and giving others access to this Geyser instance’s files.\nRemoving a name from this list will delete its cached login information on the next Geyser startup.\nThe file that tokens will be saved in is in the same folder as this config, named saved-refresh-tokens.json.\n\nFormat:\n\nsaved-user-logins:\n  - jeb_\n  - Dinnerbone\n\n\ncommand-suggestions: Bedrock clients freeze or crash when opening up the command prompt for the first time with a large amount of command suggestions. This config option disables command suggestions being sent to prevent any freezing. Since 1.16.100: command freezing and crashing has been largely reduced; you may no longer need this option disabled.\n\npassthrough-motd: If the MOTD should be relayed from the remote server. Causes the motd1 and motd2 options in the bedrock section to no longer have a use.\n\npassthrough-protocol-name: Relay the protocol name (e.g. BungeeCord [X.X], Paper 1.X) - this is only really useful when using a custom protocol name! This will also show up on sites like MCSrvStatus. \n\npassthrough-player-count: If the current and max player counts should be relayed from the remote server.\n\nlegacy-ping-passthrough: If enabled, manually pings the server by impersonating a Minecraft client instead of using the server’s API. This option should only be enabled if your MOTD or player count is not accurate, as it can cause errors especially on BungeeCord. This option does nothing on Geyser Standalone.\n\nping-passthrough-interval: How often the fake Minecraft client should attempt to ping the remote server to update information, in seconds (a setting of 1 will ping the server every second; a setting of 3 will ping the server every three seconds). Only relevant for standalone and legacy ping passthrough. Increase the number if you’re getting timeout or BrokenPipe exceptions.\n\nforward-player-ping: Whether to forward player ping to the server. While enabling this will allow Bedrock players to have more accurate ping, it may also cause players to time out more easily.\n\nmax-players: The maximum amount of players shown when pinging the server. This does not actually cap how many players can join the Geyser instance at this time. The number will visually increase when pinging if the amount of players is greater, as Bedrock clients will not even attempt to join a full server.\n\ndebug-mode: If debug messages should be printed in console. Useful if you run into an error and need more context. Yes, this will cause more messages, warnings or even errors in console - some packets aren’t translated.\n\nallow-third-party-capes: If third party (Optifine, 5zig, LabyMod, etc.) capes should be displayed to the bedrock player.\n\nallow-third-party-ears: If third party Deadmau5-style ears should be enabled. Currently only supports MinecraftCapes.\n\nshow-cooldown: Bedrock Edition currently does not have Java Edition 1.9+ combat mechanics. In order to get around this, Geyser sends a fake cooldown by sending a title message. This cooldown should not show if 1.8 combat mechanics are in use. The options available for this setting are false (no cooldown is sent), title/true (a cooldown indication is shown in the title), or actionbar (a cooldown indication is shown in the action bar). All other options default to false.\n\nshow-coordinates: Bedrock Edition has an option to show coordinates in the top-left part of your screen. This setting enables or disables this.\n\ndisable-bedrock-scaffolding: Whether Bedrock players are blocked from performing their scaffolding-style bridging.\n\nemote-offhand-workaround: Since Java Edition 1.9, clients have had the ability to switch the item in their mainhand and offhand with a keybind. Bedrock Edition does not have this ability, so this config option makes up for it, If set, when a Bedrock player performs any emote, it will swap the offhand and mainhand items, just like the Java Edition keybind. There are three options this can be set to:\n\n  disabled - the default/fallback, which doesn’t apply this workaround\n  no-emotes - emotes will NOT be sent to other Bedrock clients and offhand will be swapped. This effectively disables all emotes from being seen.\n  emotes-and-offhand - emotes will be sent to Bedrock clients and offhand will be swapped\n\n\ndefault-locale: The default locale to send to players if their locale could not be found. Check this page to find the code corresponding to your language. This option is disabled by default - to enable it, remove the “#” in front of the option.\n\ncache-images: Specify how many days images will be cached to disk to save downloading them from the internet. A value of 0 is disabled. (Default: 0)\n\nallow-custom-skulls: Allows custom skulls to be displayed when placed. Keeping them enabled may cause a performance decrease on older/weaker devices.\n\nmax-visible-custom-skulls: The maximum number of custom skulls to be displayed per player. Increasing this may decrease performance on weaker devices. Setting this to -1 will cause all custom skulls to be displayed regardless of distance or number.\n\ncustom-skull-render-distance: A number value specifying the radius in blocks around the player in which custom skulls are displayed. 32 by default.\n\nadd-non-bedrock-items: Whether to add (at this time, only) the furnace minecart as a separate item in the game, which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition. This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the “transfer packet” style of server switching. If this is disabled, furnace minecart items will be mapped to hopper minecart items. This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.\n\nabove-bedrock-nether-building: Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether - enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of the End sky in the Nether, but ultimately it’s the only way for this feature to work.\n\nforce-resource-packs: Force clients to load all resource packs if there are any. If set to false, it allows the user to disconnect from the server if they don’t want to download the resource packs.\n\nxbox-achievements-enabled: Allows Xbox achievements to be unlocked. This disables certain commands so the Bedrock client can’t “cheat” to get them; this cannot be worked around if you want to enable this. Commands such as /gamemode and /give will not work from Bedrock with this enabled.\n\nlog-player-ip-addresses: Whether player IP addresses will be logged by the server.\n\nnotify-on-new-bedrock-update: Whether to alert the console and operators that a new Geyser version is available that supports a Bedrock version that this Geyser version does not support. It’s recommended to keep this option enabled, as many Bedrock platforms auto-update.\n\nunusable-space-block: Which item to use to mark unavailable slots in a Bedrock player inventory. Examples of this are the 2x2 crafting grid while in creative, or custom inventory menus with sizes different from the usual 3x9. A barrier block is the default item (minecraft:barrier is therefore the default value). Takes any Minecraft Bedrock identifier, e.g. minecraft:apple. To set this to a custom item, you will need to add the geyser_custom: namespace.\n\nMetrics\n\nbStats is a stat tracker that is entirely anonymous and tracks only basic information about Geyser, such as how many people are online, how many servers are using Geyser, what OS is being used, etc. You can learn more about bStats here. To see Geyser Stats, see here.\n\nenabled: If metrics are enabled\n\nuuid: UUID of the server, don’t change this!\n\nAdvanced Options\n\nscoreboard-packet-threshold: Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle a lot of scoreboard packets per second can cause serious lag. This option allows you to specify after how many Scoreboard packets per seconds the Scoreboard updates will be then limited to four updates per second.\n\nenable-proxy-connections: Allow connections from ProxyPass and Waterdog.

Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PS4 systems can join third-party servers using a third-party program called BedrockConnect. For technical information about the program, including how to run your own setup, see their GitHub repository (This program is not affiliated with GeyserMC). Other methods are also available for use.\n\nThere is also a tool anyone can set up that allows you to connect to the server via adding a user to your friends list - FriendConnect, and MCXboxBroadcast. The latter one can even be set up as a Geyser Extension.\n\nNOTE: The main IP used for BedrockConnect is often blocked on consoles, if you run into issues with internet connection or joining servers after changing your DNS, consider using either one of the other BedrockConnect servers on the BedrockConnect Github Page, or the Public GeyserConnect which allows connecting to both Java and Bedrock servers.\n\nXbox One\n\n(Video linked below)\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch\n\n(Video linked below)\n\n\n\nPlayStation 4\n\n  Go to your PS4 Home screen.\n  Go to Settings.\n  Go to Network.\n  Select Set Up Internet connection.\n  If you are using wired internet, select “Use LAN Cable”, otherwise choose “Use Wi-Fi”.\n  Select the Custom network creation mode.\n  Select Automatic IP Address.\n  For DHCP Host Name, make sure you select Do Not Specify.\n  Under DNS Settings, select Manual.\n  Enter the BedrockConnect IP for the preferred Primary DNS (Multiple options depending on region can be found on the BedrockConnect Github Page) and something like Google or Cloudfare’s IP for the Secondary DNS (8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1).\n\n\nAlternative Methods\nIf you’d rather try emulating a LAN game on your network on another device, here’s how you’d do that.\n\nNote that this method will not work with the Nintendo Switch.\n\nUsing a PC\nIf you have a PC, you can use Phantom.\n\nUsing an Android Device\nIf you have an Android device, you have several options:\n\n  Geyser Android app (Discontinued)\n  BedrockTogether\n  MC Lan Proxy (Trial)\n  MC Lan Proxy (Paid)\n  MC Server Connector\n  Tempest\n\n\nUsing an iOS device\nIf you have an iOS 14+ device, you can use BedrockTogether."

So if you’re porting Geyser to a new platform, or working with platform-specific code, you likely want to be in here.\n  core is where connections are handled and the data conversion is done. The majority of Geyser work is held here.\n\n\nCompiler Tools\n\nLombok\n\nNote that the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA does not require additional setup in order to develop with Geyser.\n\nIf you’re using an IDE for editing any of the GeyserMC projects you will most likely need to install the Project Lombok plugin as it is used to generate a bunch of handy functions. You can edit without it but you may get missing functions and or other issues displayed in your IDE. Please see the IDE section on their site for the supported plugins and install methods https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview.\n\nProtocol Information\n\nGopherTunnel\nGopherTunnel is a library for Bedrock Edition written in Go.

It works for both Java Edition (using node-minecraft-protocol) and Bedrock (as a GUI wrapper for ProxyPass adding extra features). It supports features such as viewing packet data in JSON format, Edit and Resend and a hex view for raw packet data. You can download it from here. It’s currently WIP, so expect bugs.\n\nGadget\nGadget is a fabric client mod to inspect &amp; log, amongst other things, packets sent between a java server and a java client.

We will go in-depth on how to use the bot commands and its tools.\n\nServer Logs\n\nIf you are having console errors or Geyser isn’t functioning/starting up, server logs are very useful to find the root cause of why Geyser is not running. You can safely share your server logs with mclogs as it will remove all IP addresses and other sensitive information from the logs.\n\nIf you paste the logs URL into our Discord, our bot will analyze the error and will give a fix if there is one present like seen below. You can also paste the latest.log file into Discord.\n\n\n\nOCR\n\nOCR or Optical Character Recognition is something that our discord bot can process, which means if you upload a picture/image into our discord that contains an error like seen below the bot might be able to help you out with our issue.\n\n\n\nPing Server\n\nIf you are not sure if your server is reachable from the outside you can use our ping tool. Using the ping command in #bot-spam; /ping “serverip” as seen below, The bot will check if your server is online/reachable. When you are not running your server on default port: java 25565 and bedrock 19132 you will need to specify the port like /ping “serverip:serverport”.\n\nIf the bot returns Unable to find Java/Bedrock server at the requested address, your server either is not running/setup properly or your firewall is blocking the connection. More info on how to setup Geyser can be found on the Geyser Setup page.\n\n\n\nProvider List\n\nSome hosting providers have unique setup methods for Geyser. If you do not know how to setup Geyser on your provider you can either checkout the Geyser Host Provider List manually, or use our bot command /provider \"providername\" as seen below.\n\n\n\nDownload Command\n\nSends the download link of the chosen program/plugin. /download \"Geyser\" or /download \"ViaVersion\" and so on.\n\nLeaderboard Command\n\nProvides a link to the Geyser Bot XP leaderboards.\n\nRank Command\n\nYou can give yourself two types of roles on our discord, “GeyserNews” and “Testers”. You can use the command /rank \"chosen rank\" to give one to yourself.\n\nQueue Command\n\nDisplays Current global api skin queue upload times."

Implementation details for those interested in how features are added can be found here.\n\nWhile recommended, it is not required to install the resource pack on the server - clients can install it themselves. Additionally, if you use a proxy like WaterdogPE, you can install the pack on the server without impacting gameplay on other Bedrock servers.\n\nResource pack conflicts\n\nIf your current server resource pack contains any entity definitions that overlap with the optional pack, you will need to merge the definitions for these entities for the optional pack and your own pack to work correctly. Otherwise, the prevailing entity definition will be based on pack application order. This process is best performed manually due to the complexity of entity definition files, though it can also be scripted."
